# Goodreads Creative Brief

### Company Overview

Launched in January 2007, Goodreads is a "social cataloging" site owned by Amazon that offers its users book recommendations based on their interests and previous book ratings as well as features that allow its users to write book reviews and discuss books. Users can also create their own groups of book suggestions, surveys/polls, and blogs.

The site's features can be divided into three main categories: book discovery, content access, and user interaction. Users can add books to their "bookshelves," rate, and review books, see what their friends and favorite authors are reading, and participate in discussion boards as part of the "book discovery" features. Goodreads' content access features also allows users to read or listen to a preview of a book using Kindle Cloud Reader and Audible. In addition, the site offers quizzes and trivia, quotations, book lists, and free giveaways. Users can also share their experience reading and discussing books on other networking platforms through Goodreads' user interaction features.


### SWOT Analysis

The company's strengths include:
- Its massive book database
- Its number of users
- Its integration with Kindle Cloud Reader and Audible for content access
- Its integration with Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter for user interaction

The company's weaknesses include:
- Its plain brand colors
- Its inventory-like "bookshelves"
- Its lack of personalization on the site itself. My favorite books feel precious to me. Unlike other media, books take a considerable amount of time to consume. A book is very much an investment and becomes a part of who you are because it expresses ideas that then stay with you wherever you go. Goodreads' site currently feels impersonal and somewhat competitive. I don't like seeing the word "Stats" in my bookshelf menu for one thing.
- Its need to create a more fun identity

The company's opportunities include:
- Creating some kind of quality rating system to distinguish between literary fiction and popular fiction in addition to the user reviews system (similar to hotel star ratings and customer reviews). You could even separate the site into multiple catalogs based on this and other criteria.
- Allowing users to personalize the appearance of their profile and bookshelf pages
- Offering users monthly "bookshelves" with five suggested books tailored to their interests and favorite authors and/or genres. This could be similar to Spotify's Discover Weekly playlists.

The company's threats include:
- Amazon itself. Why do users need to log onto Goodreads for reviews when they can see similar reviews on Amazon's site?
